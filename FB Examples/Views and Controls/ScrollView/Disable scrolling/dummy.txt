Deaf Ted, Danoota, (and me)

Thorg hilly grove and burly ive,
Big daleys grass and tree 
We clobber ever gallup 
Deaf Ted, Danoota, and me.

Never shall we partly stray,
Fast stirrup all we three 
Fight the battle mighty sword 
Deaf Ted, Danoota, and me.

With faithful frog beside us,
Big mighty club are we 
The battle scab and frisky dyke 
Deaf Ted, Danoota, and me.

We fight the baddy baddies,
For colour, race and cree
For Negro, Jew and Bernie
Deaf Ted, Danoota, and me.

Thorg Billy grows and Burnley ten,
And Aston Villa three 
We clobber ever gallup 
Deaf Ted, Danoota and me.

So if you hear a wondrous sight,
Am bluster or at sea, 
Remember whom the mighty say 
Deaf Ted, Danoota, and me-

(sometimes we bring our friend, Malcolm.)
